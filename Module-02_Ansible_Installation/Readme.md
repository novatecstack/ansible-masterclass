# Setting up the environment for Ansible Playbooks execution (CentOS)

- There will be two machines in this setup: 
  1. <b>AnsibleServer</b>, where we will execute all the playbooks. We are using CentOS 7.x machine in this lab.
  2. <b>TargetMachine</b>, to which "AnsibleServer" will send the instructions mentioned via playbook tasks and eventually will be executed here. It could be any linux machine.
  3. Make sure there is a connectivity between both the machines over SSH/RDP
